Once your camera is set up, you're ready to start tracking your posture while browsing the web.

## Starting Posture Tracking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the extension popup">
    Click the Posture!Posture!Posture! icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch the Options window">
    Click the "Open Popup" button. This opens a new window with the camera controls and live video feed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sit with good posture">
    **Important**: Before clicking Start, position yourself with proper posture - back straight, shoulders back, head level. This becomes your baseline.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Start' to begin tracking">
    Click the green "Start" button on the Options page. The extension will:
    - Activate your webcam
    - Load the MoveNet pose detection model
    - Begin tracking your posture
    - Set the extension badge to "ON"
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The first time you start tracking, you may need to grant camera permissions. See the [Camera Setup](/guide/setup-camera) guide for details.
</Note>

### Visual Confirmation

When tracking starts successfully, you'll see:

- Live video feed from your camera
- Colored dots (keypoints) overlaying your body on the video
- A white horizontal line showing your good posture baseline
- Another line showing your current eye position
- The browser extension badge changes to "ON"
- The page title updates to "TRACKING POSTURE - Posture!Posture!Posture!"

## Understanding the Video Preview

The Options page shows your webcam feed with pose detection overlays:

### Keypoints

Colored dots appear on detected body parts (eyes, nose, shoulders, etc.):

- **Green keypoints**: Your posture is good (within the deviation threshold)
- **Red keypoints**: You're slouching (beyond the deviation threshold)

```typescript
ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.9)'; // green if within threshold
if (delta > 25 || delta < -25) {
  ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.9)'; // red if slouching
}
```

### Baseline and Position Lines

**White horizontal line**: Your good posture baseline (set when you first started tracking)

**Current position line**: Shows where your right eye is now

### Delta Visualization

A colored rectangle between the two lines shows the difference:

- **Green rectangle**: Small deviation, still considered good posture
- **Red rectangle**: Large deviation, triggers the blur effect

<Tip>
  Watch the delta rectangle as you slouch and sit back up. It provides immediate visual feedback on how your posture changes affect the tracking.
</Tip>

## The Blur Effect in Action

When tracking detects bad posture, web pages automatically blur to encourage you to sit up straight.

### How It Responds

**When you slouch** (eye position moves more than 25 pixels from baseline):
- Web page content blurs with a 4px blur filter
- Transition takes 0.6 seconds (smooth fade-in)
- A status message "Sit Up Straight!" appears in the bottom-right corner
- Extension continues monitoring

**When you sit up straight** (eye position returns within 25 pixels of baseline):
- Blur effect removes immediately
- Transition takes 0.3 seconds (quick fade-out)
- Status message disappears
- You can continue browsing normally

<Note>
  The blur applies to **all web pages** you visit while tracking is active, creating a consistent reminder across your entire browsing session.
</Note>

### What Gets Blurred?

The blur effect applies to all page content except the extension's own interface:

```css
.bad-posture > *:not(#kr-posture-app-content) {
  filter: blur(4px);
  transition: ease-in 0.6s;
}
```

This means:
- All text, images, and UI elements blur
- The status bar remains sharp and readable
- The blur is noticeable but not completely illegible

## Using the Browser Popup Controls

Once tracking is running, you can control it from the browser toolbar popup without opening the full Options window.

### Available Controls

**Start/Stop Button**:
- Green "Start" button when tracking is off
- Red "Stop" button when tracking is active
- Toggles tracking on/off with one click

```typescript
async function toggleWatching() {
  port.current.postMessage({
    action: 'TOGGLE_WATCHING',
    payload: { isWatching: !isWatching },
  });
  setIsWatching((isWatching) => !isWatching);
}
```

**Reset Posture Button**:
- Only appears when tracking is active
- Sets a new good posture baseline at your current position
- Useful when you intentionally change seating position

```typescript
function resetPosture() {
  port.current.postMessage({ action: 'RESET_POSTURE' });
  setStatus('Posture Reset at current position');
}
```

<Warning>
  When you click "Reset Posture," make sure you're sitting with proper posture! The extension immediately sets your current position as the new baseline.
</Warning>

## Stopping Posture Tracking

You can stop tracking at any time:

### From the Options Page

1. Click the red "Stop" button
2. The webcam turns off
3. The extension badge changes to "OFF"
4. Blur effects are removed from all pages
5. The page title updates to "Posture!Posture!Posture! - Options"

### From the Browser Popup

1. Click the Posture!Posture!Posture! extension icon
2. Click the red "Stop" button
3. Tracking stops immediately

### Closing the Options Window

<Warning>
  If you close the Options window entirely, tracking stops automatically. The Options page must remain open (though it can be minimized) for continuous tracking.
</Warning>

## Typical Tracking Workflow

Here's a recommended daily workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Morning: Set your baseline">
    When you start working:
    1. Open the extension popup
    2. Click "Open Popup" to launch Options
    3. Sit with excellent posture
    4. Click "Start" to establish your baseline
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="During work: Monitor continuously">
    - Position the Options window on a secondary monitor or minimize it
    - Browse normally - the blur effect will remind you if you slouch
    - Glance at the video preview occasionally to see your posture tracking
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="After breaks: Reset if needed">
    When you return from lunch or a break:
    1. Sit with good posture
    2. Click "Reset Posture" in the popup
    3. Continue working with the new baseline
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="End of day: Stop tracking">
    When you're done working:
    1. Click "Stop" in the popup or Options page
    2. Close the Options window
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tracking Status Indicators

The extension provides several ways to check if tracking is active:

### Extension Badge

- **"ON"** badge: Tracking is currently active
- **"OFF"** badge: Tracking is stopped

```typescript
if (!isCurrentlyWatching) {
  chrome.action.setBadgeText({ text: 'ON' });
} else {
  chrome.action.setBadgeText({ text: 'OFF' });
}
```

### Options Page Title

- **"TRACKING POSTURE - Posture!Posture!Posture!"**: Tracking is active
- **"Posture!Posture!Posture! - Options"**: Tracking is stopped

### Video Feed

- Camera active with keypoints visible: Tracking is running
- "Start Camera" message: Tracking is stopped

## Detection Frequency

The extension performs pose detection every **100 milliseconds** (10 times per second):

```typescript
const DETECTION_RATE = 100; // ms

setInterval(() => {
  return detect(detector);
}, DETECTION_RATE);
```

This frequency provides:
- Responsive feedback when you slouch or sit up
- Smooth transitions of the blur effect
- Minimal CPU/GPU usage
- Real-time tracking without lag

<Note>
  You won't notice the 100ms intervals - the tracking feels continuous and immediate. The blur effect applies within a fraction of a second when you slouch.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Tracking Issues

### Blur Effect Not Appearing

**Possible causes:**
1. Tracking isn't started - check for "ON" badge
2. Options window is closed - keep it open (can be minimized)
3. Your posture is actually good! Try slouching significantly to test
4. Camera isn't detecting your face - check the video preview

### Blur Effect Constantly Active

**Possible causes:**
1. Baseline was set while slouching - click "Reset Posture" while sitting straight
2. Camera angle changed - reposition camera or reset baseline
3. Lighting changed dramatically - improve lighting or reset baseline
4. Wrong camera selected - switch to the camera facing you

### Keypoints Not Showing

**Possible causes:**
1. Camera isn't detecting a person - ensure you're in frame
2. Poor lighting - add light sources
3. Obstruction blocking view - remove objects between you and camera
4. MoveNet model still loading - wait 10-20 seconds after starting

### Erratic Behavior

**Possible causes:**
1. Busy CPU/GPU - close other heavy applications
2. Multiple people in frame - MoveNet tracks the most prominent person
3. Complex background - use a simpler background for better detection

<Tip>
  Watch the keypoints in the video preview. If they're bouncing around or frequently red, try adjusting your camera position, lighting, or distance from the camera.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### For Accurate Tracking

1. **Set baseline when truly sitting well**: Don't rush - take time to position yourself properly
2. **Keep consistent lighting**: Dramatic light changes can affect detection
3. **Maintain camera position**: Don't move or adjust your camera after setting the baseline
4. **Stay in frame**: Ensure your head and shoulders remain visible
5. **Reset when changing positions**: If you adjust your chair height or desk, reset the baseline

### For Best Results

1. **Use on a secondary monitor**: Keep the Options window visible for real-time feedback
2. **Check in periodically**: Glance at the video feed to see your posture objectively
3. **Don't fight it**: If the blur appears, sit up - it's doing its job!
4. **Reset after breaks**: Your seating position often changes after leaving your desk
5. **Combine with ergonomics**: The extension works best when paired with a proper ergonomic setup

<Note>
  Posture!Posture!Posture! is a reminder tool, not a replacement for good ergonomic practices. Ensure your desk, chair, and monitor are properly positioned for healthy posture.
