# Posture!Posture!Posture!

Sit up straight! This browser extension helps you maintain good posture while surfing the web by using your webcam and AI-powered pose detection to monitor your sitting position in real-time.

## How It Works

Posture!Posture!Posture! uses TensorFlow.js and the MoveNet model to track your body position through your webcam. Here's the process:

1. **Establish a baseline** - The extension captures your position when you're sitting with good posture
2. **Continuous monitoring** - Your eye position is tracked at 100ms intervals using pose detection
3. **Visual feedback** - When you slouch or deviate from your baseline, the browser applies a blur effect to all web pages
4. **Instant correction** - As soon as you sit back up straight, the blur disappears and you can browse normally

<Note>
All processing happens locally in your browser. Your webcam feed never leaves your device, and no data is collected or transmitted.

## Privacy & Permissions

The extension requires camera access and the ability to modify web pages to provide the blur effect. However:

- No analytics or tracking libraries are included
- Your webcam feed is processed locally and never transmitted
- No user data is collected or stored
- The only data visible to developers is standard browser store statistics (install/uninstall counts, active users)

<Warning>
On first use, you'll need to grant camera permission to the extension. This is required for pose detection to work.
</Warning>
