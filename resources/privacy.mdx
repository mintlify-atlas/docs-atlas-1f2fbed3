# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is paramount. This page explains exactly what data the extension accesses, how it's used, and what never leaves your device.

## No Data Collection

<Note>
**Zero tracking, zero analytics, zero data collection.** The extension does not include any analytics libraries or tracking mechanisms. None of your data is monitored, stored, or transmitted anywhere.
</Note>

The developer has no visibility into:
- Your camera feed or captured images
- Your browsing history or activity
- Your posture data or tracking information
- Any personal information whatsoever

The only insight available is standard Chrome Web Store/Firefox Addon Marketplace statistics visible in the Developer Dashboard, which includes:
- Number of installs and uninstalls
- Number of active users (aggregated, anonymous counts)

## Camera Access

### Why Camera Access is Required

The extension needs access to your webcam to perform real-time posture tracking. Specifically, it:

1. Captures video frames from your selected webcam
2. Processes frames locally using TensorFlow.js MoveNet model
3. Detects keypoints on your body, focusing on eye position
4. Compares current position against your baseline "good posture"
5. Triggers the blur effect when deviation is detected

### How Camera Data is Handled

<Warning>
**All camera processing happens entirely within your browser.** No images, video frames, or camera data ever leave your device.
</Warning>

Technical details:
- Video frames are processed in-memory using the `react-webcam` library
- The TensorFlow.js model runs locally using WebGL acceleration
- Only keypoint coordinates (numeric values) are extracted from frames
- No video or images are saved, stored, or transmitted
- Camera access stops immediately when you stop tracking

### Camera Permissions

On first use, your browser will prompt you to allow camera access. You can:
- Grant access to enable posture tracking
- Deny access (the extension won't function)
- Revoke access at any time through browser settings

To manage camera permissions:
- **Chrome**: Settings > Privacy and security > Site settings > Camera
- **Firefox**: Settings > Privacy & Security > Permissions > Camera

## Required Browser Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions in its manifest:

### Access Your Data on All Websites

**Permission**: `"matches": ["http://*/*", "https://*/*"]`

**Why it's needed**: The extension needs to inject a content script that can apply the blur effect to web pages when you're not sitting with good posture. Without this permission, the visual feedback mechanism wouldn't work.

**What it does NOT do**:
- Does not read or collect page content
- Does not monitor your browsing activity
- Does not track which sites you visit
- Only injects CSS to apply/remove blur effect

### Background Service Worker

**Permission**: Background script execution

**Why it's needed**: The extension uses a background service worker to relay messages between the Options page (where tracking happens) and content scripts (where blur is applied). This enables real-time communication.

**What it does NOT do**:
- Does not run continuously (only when needed)
- Does not collect or store any data
- Only passes posture status messages ("good" or "bad")

## Data Storage

The extension stores minimal data locally in your browser:

### What's Stored Locally

- **Tracking state**: Whether tracking is currently ON or OFF
- **Baseline position**: Your "good posture" eye position (numeric value)
- **Selected camera**: Device ID of your chosen webcam

This data is stored using browser storage APIs and never leaves your device.

### What's NOT Stored

- Camera images or video
- Browsing history
- Posture tracking history
- Timestamps or usage patterns
- Any personally identifiable information

## Third-Party Services

<Note>
The extension does not communicate with any third-party services or external servers.
</Note>

The only external resources are:
- **TensorFlow.js models**: Downloaded from TensorFlow's CDN when the extension initializes (standard model files, no user data transmitted)

No analytics services, no tracking pixels, no external API calls with your data.

## Open Source Transparency

Posture!Posture!Posture! is fully open source. You can:
- Review the complete source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/killa-kyle/posture-posture-posture-chrome-extension)
- Verify there's no data collection or tracking
- Build the extension yourself from source
- Contribute improvements or report issues

## Browser Vendor Data

When you install the extension from official stores:

- **Chrome Web Store**: Google may collect installation and usage statistics according to their own privacy policies
- **Firefox Addon Marketplace**: Mozilla may collect installation and usage statistics according to their own privacy policies

This data collection is handled by the browser vendors, not by the extension itself. Refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Mozilla's Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) for details.

## Your Rights

You have complete control:
- **Revoke permissions**: Disable camera or site access at any time through browser settings
- **Uninstall**: Remove the extension completely to stop all functionality
- **Inspect code**: Review the open source code to verify privacy claims
- **Local control**: All data stays on your device and is deleted when you uninstall

## Questions or Concerns

If you have privacy questions or concerns:
1. Review the [open source code](https://github.com/killa-kyle/posture-posture-posture-chrome-extension)
2. Open an issue on GitHub for specific questions
3. The developer has no access to your data, so there's nothing to request or delete

## Updates to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in the extension. Any updates will be posted in the documentation. Since no data is collected, changes won't affect your privacy - this is simply for transparency about how the extension operates.
