# Troubleshooting

Having issues with the extension? Find solutions to common problems below.

## Camera Issues

### Camera Permission Denied

**Problem**: The camera won't start or shows a permission error.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check browser permissions**
   - **Chrome**: Go to `chrome://settings/content/camera` and ensure the extension is allowed
   - **Firefox**: Go to `about:preferences#privacy`, scroll to Permissions > Camera, and check settings

2. **Grant permission when prompted**
   - When you first click "Start" in the Options page, your browser will prompt for camera access
   - Click "Allow" to enable posture tracking

3. **Check if another application is using the camera**
   - Close other apps that might be using your webcam (Zoom, Skype, etc.)
   - Some operating systems only allow one application to access the camera at a time

4. **Reload the Options page**
   - Close and reopen the Options page
   - Try starting the camera again

<Note>
On first use, you must allow camera access for the extension to function. The extension cannot track your posture without webcam access.
</Note>

### Camera Shows Black Screen

**Problem**: The camera starts but only shows a black screen.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check camera connection**
   - Ensure your webcam is properly connected
   - Try unplugging and reconnecting external webcams

2. **Test camera in other applications**
   - Open your camera in another app to verify it's working
   - If it doesn't work elsewhere, it's a hardware/driver issue

3. **Try a different camera**
   - If you have multiple webcams, use the dropdown menu in the Options page to switch cameras
   - Select a different device from the list

4. **Update camera drivers**
   - Ensure your webcam drivers are up to date
   - Check your computer manufacturer's website for driver updates

### Wrong Camera Selected

**Problem**: The extension is using the wrong webcam.

**Solution**:
- Open the Options page
- Look for the camera selection dropdown at the bottom of the options panel
- Select your preferred camera from the list
- The extension will automatically switch to the selected device

<Note>
The extension remembers your camera selection, so you only need to set this once.
</Note>

## Tracking Issues

### Tracking Not Starting

**Problem**: You clicked "Start" but tracking doesn't begin.

**Solutions**:

1. **Wait for model to load**
   - The TensorFlow.js MoveNet model needs to download and initialize on first use
   - This can take 10-30 seconds depending on your connection
   - Wait until you see the canvas overlay with skeleton tracking

2. **Ensure Options page is active**
   - The Options window must be visible/active at least once for tracking to initialize
   - After initialization, you can minimize it

3. **Check browser badge**
   - The extension icon should show an "ON" badge when tracking is active
   - If it shows "OFF", tracking has not started

4. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Right-click on the Options page and select "Inspect"
   - Look for errors in the Console tab
   - Common errors include WebGL issues or model loading failures

### Model Loading Failures

**Problem**: The pose detection model fails to load.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check internet connection**
   - The TensorFlow.js model downloads from CDN on first use
   - Ensure you have an active internet connection
   - The model is cached after first download

2. **Clear browser cache and reload**
   - Sometimes cached model files become corrupted
   - Clear your browser cache and reload the extension
   - **Chrome**: Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data
   - **Firefox**: Settings > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data > Clear Data

3. **Check if WebGL is enabled**
   - The extension uses WebGL for accelerated model inference
   - Test WebGL: Visit [https://get.webgl.org/](https://get.webgl.org/)
   - If WebGL is disabled, enable it in your browser settings

4. **Disable hardware acceleration temporarily**
   - Paradoxically, sometimes disabling hardware acceleration helps
   - **Chrome**: Settings > System > Use hardware acceleration when available
   - **Firefox**: Settings > General > Performance > Use hardware acceleration when available
   - Try toggling this setting

<Warning>
The extension requires WebGL support for TensorFlow.js to function. If WebGL is unavailable on your system, posture tracking will not work.
</Warning>

### Tracking Not Detecting Posture Changes

**Problem**: The blur effect doesn't activate when you slouch.

**Solutions**:

1. **Ensure good lighting**
   - The pose detection model needs clear visibility of your face and upper body
   - Add more light to your workspace
   - Avoid backlighting (sitting in front of a bright window)

2. **Position yourself in frame**
   - Make sure your face and upper body are visible in the camera view
   - The model specifically tracks your right eye position
   - Sit at a comfortable distance (2-4 feet from camera)

3. **Reset your baseline**
   - Your baseline might have been set incorrectly
   - Sit with good posture
   - Click "Reset Posture" in the Options page
   - The next detected position will be your new baseline

4. **Check the canvas overlay**
   - The Options page shows a canvas with keypoints and skeleton
   - Verify that keypoints are being detected (you should see dots on your body)
   - If no keypoints appear, the model isn't detecting your pose

### Blur Effect Stuck On

**Problem**: The blur effect won't go away even when sitting up straight.

**Solutions**:

1. **Reset your posture baseline**
   - Click "Reset Posture" in the Options page or browser action menu
   - Sit with good posture and let the extension recalibrate

2. **Stop and restart tracking**
   - Click "Stop" in the Options page
   - Wait a few seconds
   - Click "Start" again
   - Reset your baseline after restarting

3. **Check if extension is responding**
   - Open the Options page
   - Verify that the canvas overlay is updating in real-time
   - If frozen, reload the Options page

## Browser-Specific Issues

### Chrome: Extension Not Loading

**Problem**: The extension doesn't appear or work in Chrome.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check extension is enabled**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find "Posture!Posture!Posture!"
   - Ensure the toggle is ON (blue)

2. **Reload the extension**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click the reload icon on the extension card

3. **Reinstall from Chrome Web Store**
   - Remove the extension
   - Reinstall from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/posturepostureposture/ekleaenhplpaiincbdkbebmeccfgmbll)

### Firefox: Extension Not Loading

**Problem**: The extension doesn't appear or work in Firefox.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check extension is enabled**
   - Go to `about:addons`
   - Find "Posture!Posture!Posture!"
   - Ensure it's enabled

2. **Restart Firefox**
   - Completely close and reopen Firefox
   - Sometimes extensions need a fresh browser session

3. **Reinstall from Firefox Addon Marketplace**
   - Remove the extension
   - Reinstall from the [Firefox Addon Marketplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/posture-posture-posture/)

## Developer Mode Installation Issues

<Note>
These issues apply if you're installing from source code rather than the official stores.
</Note>

### Build Fails

**Problem**: `npm start` or `npm run build` fails.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Node.js version**
   - The extension requires Node.js >= 20.0.0
   - Check your version: `node --version`
   - Update Node.js if needed from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Clean install dependencies**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Check for missing dependencies**
   - Ensure all dependencies in `package.json` are installed
   - Run `npm install` again

### Extension Won't Load in Developer Mode

**Problem**: Chrome/Firefox won't load the unpacked extension.

**Solutions**:

1. **Build the extension first**
   - Run `npm install`
   - Run `npm start` or `npm run build`
   - Load the `build` folder, not the source folder

2. **Check manifest errors**
   - Look for errors when loading unpacked extension
   - The manifest.json must be valid JSON

3. **Ensure build folder exists**
   - Verify the `build` folder was created
   - It should contain manifest.json and bundled files

## Performance Issues

### High CPU Usage

**Problem**: The extension causes high CPU usage.

**Why this happens**: The extension runs pose detection every 100ms, which requires continuous video processing and machine learning inference.

**Solutions**:

1. **Stop tracking when not needed**
   - Click "Stop" in the Options page when you're done working
   - The badge will show "OFF"

2. **Close the Options page**
   - While tracking continues, closing the Options page reduces rendering overhead
   - The canvas overlay isn't needed for tracking to work

3. **Enable hardware acceleration**
   - Ensure WebGL hardware acceleration is enabled
   - This offloads processing to your GPU

### Browser Lag or Stuttering

**Problem**: The browser becomes slow or unresponsive.

**Solutions**:

1. **Close unnecessary tabs**
   - Reduce overall browser memory usage
   - The extension adds to existing resource usage

2. **Restart the browser**
   - Sometimes memory leaks accumulate
   - A fresh start can help

3. **Check system resources**
   - Open Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac)
   - Verify your system isn't resource-constrained
   - Close other resource-heavy applications
