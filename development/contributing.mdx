---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Posture!Posture!Posture! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, make sure you have the development environment set up properly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork and clone the repository">
    Fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/posture-posture-posture-chrome-extension.git
    cd posture-posture-posture-chrome-extension
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up development environment">
    Install dependencies and start the development server:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    
    Refer to the [Building from Source](/development/building-from-source) guide for detailed setup instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load the extension in your browser">
    Load the unpacked extension from the `build/` folder in Chrome or Firefox to test your changes.
    
    See the [Building from Source](/development/building-from-source#installation-steps) guide for browser-specific instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a feature branch">
    Create a new branch for your changes:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    
    Use descriptive branch names like `feature/adjustable-blur`, `fix/camera-permission`, or `docs/update-readme`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Make your changes** in the `src/` directory
2. **Test thoroughly** by loading the extension in your browser
3. **Run code formatting** before committing:

```bash
npm run prettier
```

<Note>
The project uses Prettier for consistent code formatting across JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, SCSS, and Markdown files.
</Note>

### Testing Your Changes

Since this is a browser extension with webcam integration, testing requires manual verification:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test the Options page">
    1. Open the extension's Options page
    2. Grant camera permissions if prompted
    3. Wait for the MoveNet model to load and start tracking
    4. Verify that pose detection is working correctly
    5. Set a "good posture" baseline
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the content script">
    1. Navigate to any website
    2. Ensure the blur effect applies when you deviate from good posture
    3. Verify the blur disappears when you return to good posture
    4. Test on multiple websites to ensure compatibility
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the popup">
    1. Click the extension icon in the browser toolbar
    2. Test the "Reset Good Posture" functionality
    3. Verify the popup UI displays correctly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the production build">
    Create a production build and test it:
    
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    
    Load the production build in your browser and verify all functionality works with minified code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Hot Reload Behavior

<Warning>
Hot module replacement is enabled for Options and Popup pages but disabled for the content script and background service worker.
</Warning>

When making changes:
- **Options/Popup pages**: Changes auto-reload
- **Content script**: Requires manual extension reload in `chrome://extensions/`
- **Background service worker**: Requires manual extension reload
- **Manifest changes**: Requires manual extension reload

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript and TypeScript

- Use **TypeScript** for new files when possible
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint)
- Use **functional components** and React Hooks
- Add **type annotations** for function parameters and return types

### File Organization

- Place new components in the appropriate `src/pages/` subdirectory
- Keep utility functions in separate modules (e.g., `modules/draw_utils.ts`)
- Use descriptive file names that reflect the component or functionality

### React Best Practices

- Use **React 17** patterns (the project uses React 17.0.2)
- Prefer **hooks** over class components
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Format your code">
    Run Prettier to ensure consistent formatting:
    
    ```bash
    npm run prettier
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test thoroughly">
    - Test all affected functionality
    - Test in both Chrome and Firefox if possible
    - Create a production build and test it
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit your changes">
    Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add adjustable blur intensity setting"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push to your fork">
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/killa-kyle/posture-posture-posture-chrome-extension) on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your fork and branch
4. Provide a clear title and description:
   - What changes did you make?
   - Why are these changes needed?
   - How did you test the changes?
5. Submit the pull request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature per PR**: Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix
- **Descriptive titles**: Use clear, concise titles that summarize the changes
- **Detailed descriptions**: Explain what, why, and how
- **Screenshots/videos**: Include visual evidence for UI changes
- **Test results**: Describe how you tested the changes

## Feature Ideas and Roadmap

The project has several potential enhancements:

### Current TODOs

- User adjustable posture deviation range
- Additional configuration options
- Improved visual feedback
- Performance optimizations

### Suggesting New Features

Before implementing a new feature:

1. **Check existing issues** to see if it's already been discussed
2. **Open an issue** to discuss the feature with maintainers
3. **Wait for feedback** before investing significant development time
4. **Implement the feature** once approved

## Privacy and Security

<Warning>
The extension requires "view all pages" permission to function. This is necessary for applying the blur effect on all websites.
</Warning>

### Privacy Commitment

- **No analytics**: The extension does not include any analytics or tracking libraries
- **No data collection**: User data never leaves the extension
- **Local processing**: All pose detection happens locally using TensorFlow.js
- **No external requests**: The extension does not make network requests

When contributing, please maintain these privacy principles:

- Do not add analytics or tracking code
- Do not collect or transmit user data
- Keep all processing local to the browser
- Do not add dependencies that compromise privacy
