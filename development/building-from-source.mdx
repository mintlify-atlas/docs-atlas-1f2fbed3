description: Learn how to set up your development environment and build the Posture!Posture!Posture! extension from source
---

This guide walks you through setting up the development environment and building the Posture!Posture!Posture! extension from source code.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
Make sure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed on your system.
</Note>

You can verify your Node.js version by running:

```bash
node --version
```

If you need to install or update Node.js, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    Clone the source repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/killa-kyle/posture-posture-posture-chrome-extension.git
    cd posture-posture-posture-chrome-extension
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install all required npm packages:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
    This will install all dependencies including:
    - React 17
    - TensorFlow.js with MoveNet pose detection
    - Webpack 5 and build tools
    - TypeScript and Babel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start development server">
    Run the development server with hot reload:
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
    This command starts the Webpack Dev Server and watches for file changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load the extension in your browser">
    ### For Chrome:
    
    1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
    2. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner
    3. Click **Load unpacked**
    4. Select the `build` folder from the project directory
    
    ### For Firefox:
    
    1. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
    2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**
    3. Select the `manifest.json` file from the `build` folder
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Build Commands

The project includes several npm scripts for different build tasks:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Development
npm start
```

```bash Production
npm run build
```

```bash Format Code
npm run prettier
```

</CodeGroup>

### Command Details

- **`npm start`** - Starts the Webpack development server with hot module replacement. The build output goes to the `build/` directory.
- **`npm run build`** - Creates an optimized production build with minification and source maps disabled.
- **`npm run prettier`** - Formats all JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, SCSS, and Markdown files using Prettier.

## Build Configuration

The extension uses Webpack 5 for bundling with the following key features:

- **Entry Points**: Four separate bundles are created:
  - `options.bundle.js` - Options page UI
  - `popup.bundle.js` - Browser action popup
  - `background.bundle.js` - Service worker
  - `contentScript.bundle.js` - Content script injected into web pages

- **Hot Module Replacement**: Enabled for the Options and Popup pages during development (disabled for content script)

- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript compilation with `ts-loader`

- **Babel Transpilation**: ES6+ features transpiled for browser compatibility

- **Asset Handling**: Automatic copying of manifest, icons, and stylesheets to the build directory

<Warning>
The production build uses Terser for minification and code optimization. Make sure to test the production build before distributing the extension.
</Warning>

## Development vs Production

The build process automatically adjusts based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

| Feature | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Source maps | Enabled (`cheap-module-source-map`) | Disabled |
| Minification | Disabled | Enabled (Terser) |
| Hot reload | Enabled | Disabled |
| Optimization | Minimal | Full |

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js Version Error

If you see an error about Node.js version compatibility, ensure you're running Node.js 20 or higher:

```bash
node --version  # Should show v20.0.0 or higher
```

### Build Folder Not Found

If the `build` folder doesn't exist, make sure you've run either `npm start` or `npm run build` at least once. The build folder is generated automatically by Webpack.

### Camera Permissions

<Note>
The extension requires webcam access to function. You'll need to grant camera permissions when first launching the extension.
</Note>

## Next Steps

Now that you have the extension built and running:

1. Review the [Project Structure](/development/project-structure) to understand the codebase organization
2. Read the [Contributing Guidelines](/development/contributing) before making changes
3. Open the Options page to configure and test the posture tracking feature
