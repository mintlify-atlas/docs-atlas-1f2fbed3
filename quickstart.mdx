# Quick Start

Get Posture!Posture!Posture! up and running in minutes. This guide will walk you through your first posture tracking session.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
Make sure you've [installed the extension](/installation) before proceeding.
</Note>

You'll also need:
- A working webcam
- Good lighting for optimal pose detection
- A comfortable sitting position with good posture

## Initial Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the extension popup">
    Click the Posture!Posture!Posture! icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup menu.
    
    <Note>
    If you don't see the icon, click the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon) and pin Posture!Posture!Posture!
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch the Options window">
    Click the "Open Popup" button in the extension menu. This will open a new window where you can see your webcam feed and tracking visualization.
    
    The Options window is where the AI model runs and performs pose detection.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Grant camera permission">
    When prompted, click "Allow" to grant the extension access to your webcam.
    
    <Warning>
    The extension cannot function without camera access. Your webcam feed is processed locally and never transmitted.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your camera">
    If you have multiple cameras connected, use the dropdown menu to select the camera you want to use (typically your built-in webcam or external USB camera).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Start Tracking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Position yourself with good posture">
    Before starting tracking, sit up straight in your chair with proper posture:
    - Back straight against the chair
    - Shoulders relaxed and back
    - Eyes level with the top third of your monitor
    - Feet flat on the floor
    
    This position will be your baseline "good posture" position.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the camera">
    Click the "Start" button in the Options window. The webcam feed will appear along with real-time pose detection visualization.
    
    You'll see:
    - Your live webcam feed
    - Skeletal tracking overlay showing detected keypoints
    - A green line indicating your baseline good posture height
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for model initialization">
    The TensorFlow.js MoveNet model will load and begin tracking. This takes a few seconds on first launch.
    
    Once tracking starts, the extension will automatically capture your current eye position as the baseline for good posture.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Keep the Options window open">
    <Warning>
    The Options window must remain open (though it can be minimized) for tracking to work. The pose detection model runs in this window.
    </Warning>
    
    The browser badge will show "ON" to indicate tracking is active.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test Your Setup

Now that tracking is active, let's verify everything is working:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse normally">
    Open a new tab and browse to any website. While maintaining your good posture, pages should appear normal without any blur effect.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Slouch intentionally">
    Now slouch or lean forward significantly. Within 1-2 seconds, you should notice:
    - Web pages become blurred
    - A "Sit Up Straight!" message appears at the top of the page
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Return to good posture">
    Sit back up to your original good posture position. The blur effect should disappear immediately, allowing you to browse normally again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The extension detects posture changes every 100ms and compares your current eye position to your baseline. If you deviate by more than 25 pixels, the blur effect is applied.
</Note>

## Using the Extension

### Reset Your Posture Baseline

If you need to adjust your seating position or want to set a new "good posture" baseline:

**Option 1: From the Options window**
- Click the "Reset Posture" button while tracking is active

- The extension will automatically capture the new baseline

**Option 2: From the popup menu**

### Stop and Start Tracking

You can toggle tracking on and off at any time:

- **From the Options window**: Click the "Stop" button (or "Start" to resume)

When tracking is off, the badge will show "OFF" and no blur effect will be applied.

2. Select your preferred camera
3. Tracking will restart automatically with the new camera

## Tips for Best Results

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Proper Lighting" icon="lightbulb">
    Ensure your face is well-lit for optimal pose detection. Natural light or a desk lamp works best.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Keep Window Open" icon="window-maximize">
    The Options window must stay open (can be minimized to taskbar) for tracking to work.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Stable Position" icon="chair">
    Set your baseline in a comfortable position you can maintain throughout your browsing session.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Adjust Sensitivity" icon="sliders">
    The deviation threshold is set to 25 pixels by default. This provides good balance between sensitivity and false positives.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Issues

### The blur effect isn't appearing

1. Verify the Options window is open and tracking is started (badge shows "ON")
2. Check that the green baseline line is visible in the Options window
3. Try slouching more dramatically to trigger the effect
4. Ensure your face is visible and well-lit in the webcam feed

### Tracking keeps stopping

- The Options window may have been closed. Keep it open (minimized is fine)
- Check that camera permissions are still granted
- Verify good lighting conditions for pose detection

### The blur is too sensitive or not sensitive enough

The default sensitivity (25 pixel deviation) works for most users, but you may need to adjust based on:
- Your distance from the webcam
- Your monitor size and position
- How much you naturally move while working

<Note>
Future updates may include user-adjustable sensitivity controls.
</Note>

### Camera not detected

1. Ensure your webcam is connected and functioning
2. Check that no other application is using the camera
3. Verify camera permissions in browser settings
4. Try selecting a different camera from the dropdown

## Next Steps

You're now ready to maintain good posture while browsing! The extension will continue to monitor your position and provide visual feedback.
